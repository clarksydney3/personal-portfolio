              During my first year of high school I learned that it was
              important to have good friendships/relationships with the people
              that support me. This year I became very close with the teacher
              that would continue to influence me through out my entire high
              school career, Tyson Sigette. I also got the pleasure to get close
              with my weight lifting coach, Brent Tinker. Both of these teachers
              both helped me very much decide what to major in for college and
              how to challenge myself physically.

              Sophomore year was amazing to begin with. I had met several new
              people, and I was in my second computer science class with my
              favorite teacher. I got my first job at Cracker Barrel. Then of
              course, covid-19 happened. I had enjoyed my spring break. I got to
              spend more time with my family, and didn't have to worry about
              school for about 6 months. This year I learned how to really value
              my family. During this time as well, I got my second job because
              the pandemic had caused Cracker Barrel to lock down. My second job
              was at Raising Canes where I learned some great time management
              skills!

              My Junior year was rocky to start off with. Our school had
              students going only 2 days a week, and I always had a ton of
              homework for first semester. During my second semester, I got back
              into lifting, started play lacrosse, and throwing shot put and
              discus for my high school team. During this time I learned a lot
              of time management skills, work in teams, how to be competitive,
              and how to live a healthy work style.

              While I am still techincally in my senior year, I know a majority
              of what I learned. This year I learned more about computer science
              and different types of computer science jobs in the real world.
              These expireiences helped me become sure that I wanted to major in
              computer engineering and computer science. This year I also met so
              many great people in my Caps class, and I will always be greatful
              that I had the oppurtunity to learn with them and grow some long
              lasting relationships.
