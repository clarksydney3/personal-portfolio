          <h2>Overall Lessons From Freshman Year</h2>
          <p>
            During my first year of high school I learned that it was important
            to have good frienships/relationships with the people that support
            me. This year I became very close with the teacher that would
            continue to influence me through out my entire high school career,
            Tyson Sigette. I also got the pleasure to get close with my weight
            lifting coach, Brent Tinker. Both of these teachers both helped me
            very much decide what to major in for college and how to lift.

          <h2>Overall Lessons Learned from Sophomore Year</h2>
          <p>
            Sophomore year was amazing to begin with. I had met several new
            people, and I was in my second computer science class with my
            favorite teacher. I got my first job at Cracker Barrel. Then of
            course, covid-19 happened. I had enjoyed my spring break. I got to
            spend more time with my family, and didn't have to worry about
            school for about 6 months. This year I learned how to really value
            my family. During this time as well, I got my second job because the
            pandemic had caused Cracker Barrel to lock down. My second job was
            at Raising Canes where I learned some great time management skills!

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            My Junior year was rocky to start off with. Our school had students
            going only 2 days a week, and I always had a ton of homework for
            first semester. During my second semester, I got back into lifting,
            started play lacrosse, and throwing shot put and discus for my high
            school team. During this time I learned a lot of time management
            skills, work in teams, how to be competitive, and how to live a
            healthy work style.
