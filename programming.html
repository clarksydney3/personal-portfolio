              I first got into programming during a summer school course right
              before my 5th grade year. I love moving block to make logic gates,
              and solving the little puzzles. I would've never expected to
              accomplish so much towards my goal since.

              My freshman year of High School I learned blocky, python, and some
              javascript. During my sophomore year of high school I learned
              purely Java. My junior year, there was no computer science courses
              for me to take, so I didn't take any. Although I did send emails,
              and push for cybersecurity to be taught at my high school.

              My senior year I had taken cybersecurity and technology and
              logistics with STL Caps at the same time. So this year I learned
              linux, git/github, and other types of Operating Systems. I also
              learned HTML, and CSS. I had never taken a website developement
              course ever, and so this was a new challenge for me. I got to
              relearn javascript and learn svelte. This year, I really learned
              more about actual applications of computer science and the
              different types of jobs that it offers with that major. Before all
              I knew was that I liked programming, now I know that some
              posistions that I would look into for internships, and when I
              graduate college.
