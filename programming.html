          <h1>Early Interest</h1>
          <p>
            I first got into programming during a summer school course right
            before my 5th grade year. I love moving block to make logic gates,
            and solving the little puzzles. I would've never expected to
            accomplish so much towards my goal since.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="leading">
          <h1>Expierence Leading Up to STL Caps</h1>
          <p>
            My freshman year of High School I learned blocky, python, and some
            javascript. During my sophomore year of high school I learned purely
            Java. My junior year, there was no computer science courses for me
            to take, so I didn't take any. Although I did send emails, and push
            for cybersecurity to be taught at my high school.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="present">
          <h1>Expierence 2021-2022 school year</h1>
          <p>
            My senior year I had taken cybersecurity and technology and
            logistics with STL Caps at the same time. So this year I learned
            linux, git/github, and other types of Operating Systems. I also
            learned HTML, and CSS. I had never taken a website developement
            course ever, and so this was a new challenge for me. I got to also
            relearn javascript! Then I also started learning about svelte.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, I really learned more about actual applications of
            computer science and the different types of jobs that it offers with
            that major. Before all I knew was that I liked programming, now I
            know that some posistions that I would look into for internships,
            and when I graduate college.
